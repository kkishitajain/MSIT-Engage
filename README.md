On-Campus placements include a big hierarchy between the student and the company he wants
to apply to which can lead to confusion and difficulty in keeping the data secure. With this
project, I aim to remove all the hierarchy and make it a one step of application and collection of
data for both the placement coordinators as well as the students.
